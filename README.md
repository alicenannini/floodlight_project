# A Dynamic Multipath Scheduling Protocol (DMSP) in SDN 
## How it works
In the Floodlight VM, after downloading our project from this repository: 
-  From terminal type the following commands to setup for importing the project in Eclipse:
```
    mv classpath.txt .classpath
    mv project.txt .project
```
- Open eclipse, import and run the floodlight project 

or 

- From terminal:
```
    cd floodlight
    ant
    java -jar target/floodlight.jar
```
\
Then from another terminal, start mininet (insert your own controller ip):
```
    cd floodlight
    sudo mn --custom fat-tree.py --controller=remote,ip=<controller-ip>,port=6653 â€“topo=fat-tree
```
Now you can start pinging between the hosts!
